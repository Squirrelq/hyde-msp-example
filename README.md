# hyde-msp-example
Example of multiple single pages in Hugo with Hyde theme to support blog post on [Multiple single pages in Hugo](https://github.com/cpswan/hyde-msp-example)

## TL;DR
> Replace layouts/index.html with layouts/_default/single.html in your chosen theme. The home page for the site will be created from content/_index.md and additional pages can be created at content/pagename/index.md (NB no _ before index that time).

The pages generated by Hugo are served for [gh-pages branch as https://cpswan.github.io/hyde-msp-example/](https://cpswan.github.io/hyde-msp-example/)
